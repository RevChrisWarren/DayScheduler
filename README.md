## Client requested a scheduler that would allow for editable fields, save tasks into local Storage when a save button is clicked, and change background color for fields to show whether the task is in the past, present, or future.
## This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete those functions.
## This application also utilizes BootStrap, Jquery, and MomentJS functionality.
